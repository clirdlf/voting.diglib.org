Static page for voting app

This was created when Heroku (where the app is deployed) will no longer provide "free" hosting (which was only used during the actual voting month). This static page is a placeholder until a decision can be made on what to do with this moving forward.

The actual app is https://github.com/clirdlf/participatory_voting
